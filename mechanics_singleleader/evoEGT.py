# reminder: code = paper, k = N^, N = N, K = Z^, Z = Z



# I have made some changes in the python code. Now the evolutionary part is separated in a different file evoEGT.py. This file is thought as a (kind of) library, so it can be used in any time for calculating the transition probability matrix (through fixation probabilities) and the standard distribution for any set of strategies for any kind of PGG-like game (for example for what we did with the signalling paper). The most general and useful function is Wgroup2SD:

# SD, fixM = Wgroup2SD(Wgroup, HZ, payparam, beta, infocheck=True)

# The input files that the user needs to provide from its particular model is:
# --- Wgroup[i,j,k,ip]:
# coefficients that combined with he payoff parameters provide payoffs of different strategies in a group:
# i: focal player's strategy. i=0..n_strategists-1
# j: the other strategy that is in the group. j=0..n_strategists-1
# k: number of i-type individuals in the group.  k=0..N
# ip: index associated with the payoff parameters
# --- HZ:
# Z if it is a scalar and then H is calculated.
# H if it is a 2-dim array, and then Z is deduced from it is dimension
# H can be calculated before (and only once needed and the provide it saving time) with the function H(N-1,Z-1)
# --- payparam[ip]:
# set of payoff parameters. For example in regular PGG [r, -1] (assuming c=-1); for our signalling paper it would be [b, -1, -c_s]
# Specifically, sum_ip(Wgroup[i,j,k,ip]*payparam[ip]) is the payoff that an i-individual gets in a group formed by k i-individuals and N-k j-individuals
# --- beta
# selection of strength for Fermi rule
# --- infocheck
# If True make some checks for coherency in the dimension of the inputs and show some information.

# The outputs are just the stationary distribution (SD), and the transition probability matrix (fixM) where probabilities goes from rows to columns (fixM[i,j] is the probability that j takes over a i population)

# When this function is used iteratively (for example, for different payoff parameters), the user needs to calculate only once her/his Wgroup and then call Wgroup2SD for the different payparam. In this case it is better to calculate only once in the beginning H=H(Z-1,N-1) and provide it to the function, and set infocheck=False. This way of proceeding accelerates the process really a lot. The processes in evoEGT are also quite vectorized.
